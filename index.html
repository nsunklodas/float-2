                    Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass-energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E=mc2.
                    Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect." <br><br><br><br>
